# Banking-Customer-Transaction-Balance-Analysis using SQL

# Problem Statement:
Banks collect vast amounts of transactional and customer data, but deriving meaningful insights from these datasets is crucial for enhancing customer experience, identifying trends, and optimizing financial services. The challenge is to analyze customer transactions and balances to uncover patterns in deposits, withdrawals, and overall account engagement. Additionally, banks need efficient ways to segment customers based on their financial behavior to improve marketing strategies and tailor personalized service offerings.


# Solution Statement:
This project leverages SQL and Excel to analyze banking customer transactions and balances. The solution involves:

1.)Data Processing: Extracting and organizing transactional data for 100+ customers from multiple relational tables (Customers, Accounts, Transactions).
2.)Insights Generation: Identifying customer spending patterns, transaction trends, and account activity through SQL queries and Excel-based visualizations.
3.)Optimization & Decision-Making: Using aggregate functions, joins, and filters to gain insights into high-value customers, frequent transactions, and withdrawal/deposit patterns, helping the bank make data-driven decisions.
Hence,this approach enables banks to enhance customer segmentation, improve service offerings, and optimize financial operations through data-driven decision-making.
